- **Total Funding**: $226.4B+
- **Distribution**: Federal (454), State (1301), Local (326), Utility (363), Foundation (76)

## Critical Issues Identified

### 3. Program Structure
- **NYSERDA Programs**: 10 programs with realistic amounts ($15M-$5.3B)
- **DOE Programs**: Multiple ARPA-E and Advanced Manufacturing variations
- **EPA Programs**: Repetitive structure across multiple tracks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Reduce Duplicates**: Consolidate track variations into single comprehensive programs
2. **Verify Federal Programs**: Confirm DOE loan authorities and EPA funding amounts
3. **Update Data Sources**: Reflect actual program counts in monitoring dashboard
4. **Enhance Authenticity**: Focus on major, verifiable government programs

### Data Quality Standards
- Programs should reflect actual government solicitations
- Funding amounts should match published government figures
- Avoid synthetic program multiplication
- Maintain regional Northeast focus

3. **DOE Loan Programs Office**: $40B+ authority (authentic federal program)
4. **NY-Sun Incentive Program**: $0.20-$0.40/watt (authentic NYSERDA program)

## Next Steps
1. Database cleanup removing synthetic duplicates
2. Enhanced monitoring with accurate source attribution
3. Focus on quality over quantity for institutional credibility
