# Data Monitoring Strategy - IncentEdge Platform
**Created**: July 21, 2025  
**Status**: Implementation Complete

## üéØ MONITORING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Now that we have a verified database of 933 authentic incentive programs, we've implemented a comprehensive real-time monitoring system to track:

1. **Program Deadlines** - Automated detection of deadline changes and expirations
2. **Incentive Amounts** - Monitoring for funding amount updates
3. **Program Status** - Tracking availability and application status changes
4. **Data Authenticity** - Continuous verification of program information

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Database Schema Extensions**
- **Verification Tracking**: `verification_level`, `verification_date`, `verification_source`, `verification_notes`
- **Data Monitoring**: `last_data_check`, `data_source`, `deadline_status`, `amount_verified`, `deadline_verified`, `next_check_due`
- **Update Tracking**: New `program_updates` table for change history
- **Schedule Management**: New `monitoring_schedule` table for automated checks

### **Monitoring Service Features**
- **Automated URL Checking**: Validates program availability via application URLs
- **Deadline Analysis**: Parses deadline text to categorize as active/expiring/expired/ongoing
- **Update Detection**: Records changes with confidence levels and sources
- **Scheduled Monitoring**: Different frequencies based on program priority levels

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/monitoring/status` - Current monitoring status and pending updates
- `POST /api/monitoring/setup` - Initialize monitoring schedules
- `POST /api/monitoring/check` - Manual trigger for program checks
- `POST /api/monitoring/update/:id/apply` - Apply detected updates
- `POST /api/monitoring/analyze-deadlines` - Analyze all program deadlines

## üìä MONITORING PRIORITIES

### **Level 5 Programs (32 programs) - CRITICAL**
- **Check Frequency**: Daily
- **Focus**: Amount verification, deadline tracking, status monitoring
- **Examples**: EPA ($54B), DOE ($67B), NYSERDA ($5.3B), Connecticut Green Bank ($4B)
- **Action**: Immediate alerts for any changes

### **Level 4 Programs (376 programs) - HIGH**  
- **Check Frequency**: Weekly
- **Focus**: Deadline tracking, availability monitoring
- **Examples**: All Northeast utilities, power authorities, system operators
- **Action**: Regular verification with 48-hour review window

### **Level 3 Programs (51 programs) - MEDIUM**
- **Check Frequency**: Monthly
- **Focus**: Status verification, basic availability
- **Examples**: Federal agency categories, regional programs
- **Action**: Quarterly deep verification

### **Level 2 Programs (474 programs) - LOW**
- **Check Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Focus**: General availability, major changes only
- **Examples**: Foundations, corporations, associations
- **Action**: Annual comprehensive review

## üö® ALERT SYSTEM

### **Critical Alerts (Immediate Action)**
- Level 5 program deadline changes
- Major funding amount modifications ($10M+ changes)
- Program status changes from active to expired
- URL availability failures for high-priority programs

### **Standard Alerts (24-48 Hour Review)**
- Level 4 program deadline updates
- Moderate funding changes ($1M+ changes)  
- Application process modifications
- New requirements or eligibility criteria

### **Information Alerts (Weekly Review)**
- Minor program updates
- Contact information changes
- Documentation updates
- Application deadline extensions

---

## üìà AUTOMATION FEATURES

### **Smart Deadline Detection**
```
ONGOING: "ongoing", "continuous", "rolling basis"
ACTIVE: Current year dates, "accepting applications"
EXPIRING: Within 30 days of deadline
EXPIRED: Past dates, "closed", "no longer accepting"
```

### **Confidence Scoring**
- **HIGH**: Official source verification, API integration
- **MEDIUM**: Website structure changes, pattern matching
- **LOW**: Indirect indicators, third-party reports

### **Update Verification Process**
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring identifies potential change
2. **Recording**: Update logged with confidence level and source
3. **Review**: Manual or automated verification based on confidence
4. **Application**: Approved changes applied to main database
5. **Notification**: Stakeholders informed of critical changes
