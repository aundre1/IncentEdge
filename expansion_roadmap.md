# IncentEdge Database Expansion Roadmap

## Current Status: 32 Programs â†’ Target: 200+ Programs

### Phase 1: Immediate Expansion (24-48 hours)
**Target: 60-80 programs**

#### What I Need From You:
1. **Run the automation script**: `python3 scale_database.py`
2. **Monitor progress** in the terminal output
3. **Verify results** on your dashboard

#### Automated Actions:
- Scrape 14 government sources with GPT-3.5-turbo
- Extract programs from NYSERDA, DOE, EPA, IRS websites
- Process PDFs and HTML content automatically
- Add structured data to PostgreSQL database

#### Expected Results:
- 20-30 new federal programs (IRS, DOE, EPA)
- 15-20 new state programs (NYSERDA, state agencies)
- 5-10 new utility programs
- Real-time dashboard updates

### Phase 2: Strategic Expansion (Week 1)
**Target: 120-150 programs**

#### What You Need To Do:
1. **Add new source configurations** (I'll provide YAML templates)
2. **Run weekly automation** using the script
3. **Review and approve** new program additions

#### Sources to Add:
- California Energy Commission programs
- Texas State Energy Office initiatives  
- Utility companies (ConEd, PG&E, ComEd)
- Municipal programs (NYC, SF, Austin)

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Month 1)
**Target: 200+ programs**

#### Advanced Features:
- **Real-time monitoring** of government websites
- **Automatic updates** when programs change
- **Quality scoring** for program reliability
- **Geographic expansion** to all 50 states

## Investment Required From You:

### Time Investment:
- **Initial setup**: 2-3 hours (running scripts, monitoring)
- **Weekly maintenance**: 1 hour (reviewing new programs)
- **Monthly optimization**: 2-3 hours (adding new sources)

### Cost Investment:
- **OpenAI API**: $30-60/month (already active)
- **Compute resources**: Already covered by Replit
- **No additional infrastructure needed**

## Success Metrics:

### Database Growth:
- Week 1: 80+ programs
- Week 2: 120+ programs  
- Month 1: 200+ programs

### Market Position:
- **Competitive advantage**: 3x more programs than basic competitors
- **Data freshness**: Real-time vs. quarterly competitor updates
- **Quality**: AI-verified vs. manual competitor databases

## Next Steps - What To Do Now:

1. **Run the expansion script**: `python3 scale_database.py`
2. **Let it complete all batches** (30-60 minutes total)
3. **Check your dashboard** for new program counts
4. **Review results** and confirm data quality

The system is fully automated - just execute the script and watch your database grow!
