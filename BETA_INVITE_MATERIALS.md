## 1. Beta Welcome Email

### Email 1: Initial Invitation

**Subject:** IncentEdge Beta Launch - You're Invited! 🚀

**From:** Aundre Oldacre (aundre@incentedge.dev)

```
Hi [User Name],

I'm thrilled to invite you to be one of our inaugural 5 beta testers
for IncentEdge — "The Bloomberg Terminal for Incentives."

After 6 weeks of development, we're at an exciting inflection point.
We've built a platform that discovers and analyzes $500B+ in fragmented
incentives for renewable energy and efficiency projects. Now, we need
people like you — someone who understands this market — to help us
validate the product before our public launch.

WHAT YOU'RE GETTING:
✅ Full access to all IncentEdge features
✅ Direct communication channel with me (the founder)
✅ Opportunity to shape the product roadmap
✅ Free access through March (normally $29/month)
✅ Your input in every major decision

THE OPPORTUNITY:
This is a rare moment. You're helping build infrastructure for an
industry that needs it. And you're getting an inside look at how
a bootstrapped startup scales.

HOW IT WORKS:
• Feb 28 - Mar 10: You test and give feedback
• Mar 10: Public launch (you're already inside)
• Mar 15+: We incorporate your feedback, iterate
• Apr: Paid launch (you decide if it's worth $29/mo)

GET STARTED:

1. Click here to set your password: [MAGIC_LINK]
2. Log in at https://incentedge.dev
3. Spend 2-3 hours exploring (see "First Steps" below)
4. Fill out the feedback survey (5 min) → [FORM_LINK]

FIRST STEPS (30 minutes):

1. Create a test project
   Example: 5MW rooftop solar on a commercial building

2. Run an eligibility search
   We'll show you what incentives your project qualifies for

3. Try semantic search
   Search "solar energy tax credit" and see our AI-powered results

4. Browse your results
   Each incentive shows eligibility score, application timeline, estimated value

5. Submit quick feedback
   What worked? What confused you? What's missing?

TESTING EXPECTATIONS:

We're looking for:
→ Bugs (things that don't work)
→ UX problems (things that are confusing)
→ Feature gaps (things that should exist)
→ "Aha!" moments (things that are great)

Timeline for each bug:
→ Report it in Slack or email
→ We'll reproduce and prioritize
→ Critical bugs fixed within 24 hours
→ High priority bugs fixed within 48 hours

HOW TO REACH US:

Slack (fastest):     #incentedge-beta
Email:               support@incentedge.dev
Direct to me:        [Aundre's phone/signal]

WHAT TO TEST:

To help us get maximum coverage, here's what would help most:

Core Workflows:
□ Create a project (try different project types)
□ Search for incentives (try different search terms)
□ View eligibility matches (check if they make sense)
□ Export a report (share with a colleague?)

Advanced Features:
□ Batch upload projects (if your business has 50+ properties)
□ Team collaboration (invite a colleague to review)
□ API access (if you're technical)
□ Custom reports (try different date ranges)

Edge Cases:
□ Try projects in different states
□ Try projects with different technologies
□ Try multi-incentive stacking
□ Try on your phone (does it work?)

NO PRESSURE:
Test what's relevant to your use case. If you spend 1 hour or 5 hours,
that's perfect. The goal is genuine feedback from real people.

WHAT'S READY & WHAT'S NOT:

✅ READY:
- User authentication
- Project management
- Eligibility analysis
- Semantic search
- Incentive discovery
- Basic reporting
- Team access
- API keys

⚠️  BETA (MIGHT BE ROUGH):
- Mobile responsiveness
- Large exports (>10,000 records)
- Webhook notifications
- Advanced analytics

🚫 NOT YET:
- Mobile app
- Advanced AI recommendations
- Custom tax calculations
- White-label platform

IMPORTANT: KNOWN LIMITATIONS

This is beta software. Expect:
• UI might not be perfect
• Some features might be slow
• Occasional bugs or crashes
• Your feedback will change things

This is not production-grade yet. We're testing, learning, improving.

NEXT STEPS:

1. Click the password reset link above
2. Log in this week (Feb 28 or Mar 1)
3. Spend 1-5 hours exploring
4. Report bugs in Slack/email

journey.

them to the beta.

### Email 3: Mid-Week Check-In (Mar 3)

**Subject:** How's IncentEdge treating you? Feedback welcome

**Timing:** Send on Day 4 of beta (Mar 3)

```
Hi [User Name],

Just checking in on your IncentEdge experience so far.

We've been watching the logs and things look good:
✅ Platform is stable
✅ No major crashes
✅ Users are testing deeply

FEEDBACK HIGHLIGHTS SO FAR:
[Share 1-2 positive quotes without names]
[Ask what could be improved]

IF YOU HAVEN'T TESTED YET:
No worries! You still have time (through Mar 10).
Just a reminder that your feedback helps us improve.

SPECIAL REQUEST:
If you have access to real project data, testing with that would
be incredibly valuable. We need to know:

A HEADS UP:
We made a few improvements based on early feedback:

TRY THEM OUT!

See you on the platform,
Aundre

## Searching for Incentives

### Method 1: Keyword Search

- "heat pump rebate"
- "Section 45L new construction"

### Method 2: Semantic Search (AI-Powered)
Describe what you need in natural language:
- "Federal tax credits for energy efficiency retrofits"
- "State rebates for residential solar plus battery storage"
- "Direct pay incentives I can claim immediately"

Results are ranked by relevance, not just keywords.

## Understanding Eligibility Scores

| Score | Meaning | What to Do |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 95-100% | Perfect match | This project qualifies |
| 80-94% | Strong match | Project likely qualifies |
| 60-79% | Possible match | Review requirements carefully |
| 40-59% | Weak match | Unlikely but possible |
| <40% | Poor match | Unlikely to qualify |

## Testing Tips

### What We Need Most:
1. **Accuracy feedback**
   - Do eligibility matches make sense?
   - Are incentive amounts realistic?
   - Are program descriptions helpful?

2. **UX feedback**
   - What's confusing?
   - What could be easier?
   - Where would you add a feature?

3. **Bug reports**
   - Anything that breaks?
   - Performance issues?
   - Data missing?

### How to Test Effectively:
1. Use real projects when possible
2. Test different states and technologies
3. Try searching in different ways
4. Export reports and review
5. Share with colleagues for feedback
